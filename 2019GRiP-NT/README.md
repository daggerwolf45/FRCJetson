This is the code used in 2019 for our robot's self driving system. It identifies scoring holes for hatches and panels and sends the robot the center x and y coors.

## THIS VERSION USES AN OLD VERSION OF NETWORKTABLES!!
It is highly depriciated and WILL NOT BE UPDATED! it is highly recomended to use the new BN (basic networking) verison.
